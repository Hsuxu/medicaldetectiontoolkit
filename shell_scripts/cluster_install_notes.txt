 - copy all source files of mdt-public to cluster destination, e.g., by using update_scripts_on_cluster.sh.

 - log in to a COMPUTE NODE, e.g., e132-comp01, not one of the worker/submission since we need CUDA installed.

 - run:

			module load python/3.7.0
			module load gcc/7.2.0

			virtualenv -p python3.7 <VENV_NAME>
			source <VENV_NAME>/bin/activate

			export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-${CUDA} 
			export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="6.1;7.0;7.5"

			cd mdt-public
			python setup.py install #--> check that custom extension are installed successfully.



after install:
 - until we have a better solution: submit jobs not from the recommended worker nodes but from a compute node (since we need /datasets to be mounted for job submission).
